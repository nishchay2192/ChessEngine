# ChessEngine
A basic Chess Engine as a side project implemented in Java
This is an attempt to create a robust backend chess engine in Java. One can easily call it's functions and create a front end over it
Current Status: Supports 2 player chess. In the long run I will try to make it intelligent enough to play against humans.
